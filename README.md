**A library recreating standard libc functions, with a few extra niceties.**

Foreword
---

This is a programming assignment for first year students at 42.

If you are browsing this repo, chances are you're a 42 student yourself, and working on your lib. If so, use your best judgement.

A minimal Travis CI setup is included. It'll only check for successful builds, and doesn't ensure proper operation of the library like unit tests would.
